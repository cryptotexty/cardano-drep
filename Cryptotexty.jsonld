For the future, I have some plans for the creation of the Cardano Hub in Kyiv, an important city in the region.\n\nDuring these years, I worked as an advisor and consultant with several businesses and entrepreneurs who were interested in Cardano. I see myself in this space for years if not decades.\n\nAs a political scientist (I have a degree in this), I read many books on political philosophy, and that's why I'm happy both to observe and participate in shaping the Governance of the next financial system of the world."

I hope my diverse knowledge of the cryptocurrency industry will help me to make the right decisions.\n\nAs founder of small media Cryptotexty, I traveled to more than 10 worldwide Blockchain events, and I plan to travel in the future (after the war, if I survive) and promote Cardano globally.
